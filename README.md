# Flashcard Personal Project

## Project Description

This application is a flashcard program. The user of the application can create **Flashcards** that consist of a question
and an answer. The created flashcards can be added to **Flashcard Decks** to create study sets. The user can select a deck
to study, and during the study session, the user can indicate if they got a particular flashcard correct or incorrect. 
The user can also modify or delete flashcards. In addition, users can view their study stats, which can inform the user
which flashcards they are most frequently getting incorrect.

This application is intended for students as a study and test preperation tool. This project
is of interest to me because, as a student, I use flashcards to help me study and prepare for
examinations.
