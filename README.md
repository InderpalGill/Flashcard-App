# Flashcard Personal Project

## Project Description
A large process of learning involves committing learned material to memory, and being able to recall that material when
necessary. A common study device used by many students is Flashcards. Flashcards can be effective in helping promote
active recall in the brain. Additionally, flashcards can be created such that the material written is in the user's own
words, helping to create more meaningful connections to the learned content.

This application is a flashcard program, allowing users to create and modify flashcard decks, to which they can add 
flashcards. The flashcard decks can be used for studying and practice. This application is intended for students as a study and test 
preparation tool. The application includes the following features:
- The user of the application can create a **Flashcard Deck** that can hold flashcards for studying.
- The user can then create, add, and remove **Flashcards**, which have a question and an answer, to a Flashcard Deck.
- Users can edit flashcards in a flashcard deck, changing the questions and/or answers of any flashcard.
- Users can create multiple flashcard decks and can select a deck which they want to practice/study.
- During a practice/study session, the question portion of the flashcard will be visible to the user at first, then they
can select to view the answer.
- During a practice/study session the user can indicate if they got a particular flashcard correct or incorrect.
- At the end of each practice/study session, the user will receive feedback of what percent of flashcards they answered
correctly.
- All created flashcards and flashcard decks are saved.
- The user can modify and/or delete any flashcard deck.

This project is of interest to me because, as a student, I regularly use flashcards to help me study and prepare for 
examinations. I wish to create an application that would help me create and keep track of my study habits, as well as
provide this resource to other students and learners.
