# Flashcard Personal Project

## Project Description
A large process of learning involves committing learned material to memory, and being able to recall that material when
necessary. A common study device used by many students is Flashcards. Flashcards can be effective in helping promote
active recall in the brain. Additionally, flashcards can be created such that the material written is in the user's own
words, helping to create more meaningful connections to the learned content.

This application is a flashcard program, allowing users to create and modify flashcards. The flashcards can be used to
create flashcard decks for studying and practice. This application is intended for students as a study and test 
preparation tool. The application includes the following features:
- The user of the application can create a **Flashcard** that consists of a question
  and an answer
- The created flashcards can be added to a **Flashcard Deck** to create study sets.
- Users can select a study set which they want to practice
- During a practice session, the question portion of the flashcard will be visible to the user at first, then they can select to view the answer
- During a practice session the user can indicate if they got a particular flashcard correct or incorrect
- All created flashcards and flashcard decks are saved
- The user can modify and/or delete flashcards
- Users can view their study stats, which can inform the user which flashcards they are most frequently getting incorrect

This project is of interest to me because, as a student, I regularly use flashcards to help me study and prepare for 
examinations. I wish to create an application that would help me create and keep track of my study habits, as well as
provide this resource to other students and learners.
